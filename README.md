<span style="font-size: 40p;">**Spotify Songs' Genre Segmentation Project**</span>



This project aims to construct an automated system for music recommendations based on the auditory properties of songs.
We leverage a dataset from Spotify to perform data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and modeling to achieve this goal.


**Project Overview**


The music recommendations provided by Spotify are renowned for their accuracy, utilizing algorithms that group songs based on similar features. This project endeavors to replicate and automate this process using machine learning techniques.

Project Output Instructions

**Data Pre-processing:**



Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.
Normalize or scale features as necessary.

**Data Analysis and Visualizations:**



Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics.
Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Analyze trends and patterns in the data.

**Correlation Matrix:**



Generate a correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between features.
Identify correlations between different auditory properties of songs.

**Cluster Analysis:**



Perform cluster analysis based on different parameters such as playlist genres and playlist names.
Visualize clusters using scatter plots or other suitable techniques.

**Model Building:**



Build machine learning models to predict song genres or recommend similar songs.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Optimize models as necessary.
Usage

**Dependencies:**



Python 3
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.
